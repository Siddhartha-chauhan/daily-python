# Daily Python Practice 

This repository contains my **daily Python practice**.

I use this space to regularly write small Python programs to improve my
understanding of Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

## Purpose
- Practice Python consistently
- Strengthen core programming concepts
- Improve logical thinking

## Repository Structure
Each day has one Python file named using the format:
day0X_file_name.py

### The file usually contains:
- a short description
- a small problem or idea
- a simple Python solution

## Notes
- Problems may be very small on some days — that is intentional.
- The focus is **consistency and learning**, not complexity.
- This repository will grow over time with different concepts.
